    "## Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of this Project is to create a data pipeline (end to end).  In this pipeline, a mobile device is running a game which is generating events.  These events are being consumed using Kafka (events associated to a topic). The events are being captured by a streaming application which is writing the events in a file.  As the events are being stored in files, we will be reading the files (tables), analyzing the data, and answering relevant business/game related questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This data is synthetically generated using Apache Bench included in the file \"data_generator.sh\".\n",

    "### Purpose: To understand the favorite item of customers\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Q1. Which item is most popular and how much revenue generates?   \n",
    "> ##### Q2. What items users purchased first? (Most interested item)  \n",
    "> ##### Q3. In average, how many items a player purchases?(to understand the preference of item)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose: To understand heavy users\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Q4. In average, how much money players spend in items?  \n",
    "> ##### Q5. Which customers spent the most money in items (top 5)?  \n",
    "> ##### Q6. who are the top 3 players spent the most money for item (sword, knife, shields) and guild?  \n",
    "> ##### Q7. who are the top 3 players with the most power? (measured as sum of power of item and guild he/she is member of)  \n",
    "> ##### Q8. who are the top 5 players fighting the most dragons?  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose: To understand the fight event status\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Q9. What is the average score for all players?  \n",
    "> ##### Q10. Who are the top 5 players with the highest fighting score?  \n",
    "> ##### Q11. Who has the lowest score and what is is it?  \n",
    "> ##### Q12. How many times a player fights with dragon in average?  \n",
    "> ##### Q13. What is the winning rate for each player?  \n",
    "> ##### Q14. Who are the top three playes with the most wins  \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **(4). Use Apache Bench to generate data:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "> To generate events, we created a \"game event generator\" **.sh** script which we called \"**game_event_generator.sh**\".  The details of the script are found in the Appendix section of this document.  This script has three required inputs and one optional. The descriptions of the required arguments are as follows:\n",
    ">> - **u** = Number of Users (integer >1).  Use this argument to define the number of users that the game has.\n",
    ">> - **e** = Number of endpoints (always set to 5) - this argument indicates the number of endpoints used in the game.  For this game we have five end points which are: purchase_a_sword, purchase_a_knife, purchase_a_shield, join_guild, and fight_event.\n",
    ">> - **n** = Number of total requests (integer > 1). Use this argument to indicate how many events should be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The script includes one optional argument (**b**).  When **b** is included (**-b**), the script will make calls to the game_api using **\"Apache Bench\"**.  When **b** is not included, the script will make calls to the game_api suing **\"CURL\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The following lines present two examples of calls to the \"data_generator.sh\" script:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **(a) Example of a call including option for Apache Bench:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "> bash game_event_generator.sh -u 20 -e 5 -n 100 -b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "> bash game_event_generator.sh -u 20 -e 5 -n 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** we also created a python program to generate events.  An example of how to use it is as follows:\n",

    "# IV. Business Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Recommendation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the information generated by the game_event_generator (game) script is synthetic, we would like to provide examples of the type of anlytics that may be relevant for our business partners. As a game company we are interested in improving the \"Customer Experience\" which would lead to satisfied/engaged customer who are willing to invest in \"in-game\" items/purchases and activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to improve revenue for game company? \n",
    "\n",
    "In our effort to improve the \"Player Experience\", we want to make sure that players are satisfied with items being offered.  We would like to offer more of what users want, and fix items that have less demand. Based on current analytics, we determined that 'shield' is the most popular item for customers based on the number of purchases, however 'swords' is the item that generates the most revenue as it is the most expensive item.  Players are willing to invest in 'swords' as it helps them win fights which improves their score. We should consider offering additional type of swords as players are willing to invest in them. This is confirmed by the fact that, for most players, the first item purchased is the 'sword'. In average, a player purchased 179 items so far and spent 45900 on items. Therefore, If we increase the line up of sword and other items with additional features, we can expect more customer's purchases.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "####  Customer Engagement -  How to motivate engagement? \n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to identify customers who are engaged in fighting and earning points.  We seek to reward users who win the most battles with dragons, and the ones that have the best record (wins-losts) as reflected in the total score. Customers clearing the top scores will be offered special perks such as promoting them within the ranks of players (i.e. Elite Warrior) as well as unlocking special fighting items such as new swords, shields and knifes.  From this perspective we have identified the following customers who are eligible to this perks:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Users with the best scores: user-006 (580), user-0010 (460), and user-004 (390) -> Move to next level, unlock special sword.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - User who spent the most money: user-0015 (68500), user-004 (58500), user-003 (44500)  -> Offer coupons\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Users with the most power (based on items that they own): user-0012 (74300), user-006 (61000), user-0013 (53800) -> Give special Batch recognizing their power.\n",
    "\n",
    "As fighting dragons is a popular activity within the game which earn points and status for the players, we are interested in ensuring players feel they have a fair chance to win fights.  We want to keep the chance of winning at 50% or more. Currently around 50% of players have a winning record (>=50% chance of winnin), thus no adjustment is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guild is another activity that helps increase engagment and provides a sense of community to the players. The most popular guild is \"Game_of_Thrones\" - however, membership to the guilds is comparable. Players are actively seeking to join guilds, and it seems that the current offering is enough for the number of players in the game.\n",
